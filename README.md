# cmu-ipa

The Jupyter notebook in this repository converts the ARPABET transcriptions in `cmudict-0.7b` to Unicode IPA symbols.

The notebook uses Python 3. (Note that Python /3/ makes Unicode much more straightforward and painless to deal with than Python 2.) There are no other salient dependencies.
